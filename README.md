# KG2020_G41_Task3
 Drawing circle segments
 
 what is now:
 1. Scaling&Moving screen
 2. OX,OY drawing with plenty of bugs, but scaling OX,OY with coordinates
 3. Combobox for choosing elements
 4. Working arcdrawer. But not so bresenham
 
 NEW things!
 5. Scaling figures by pulling by markers (Rectangle, Segment)
 6. Changing Segment angle using markers.
 7. key 'A' - add figure, key 'D' - delete chosen figure, key 'Z' - undo chosing figure.
 
 To avoid bugs, add figures like that: choose from combobox figure, put it on the panel, press 'A', choose added figure, use markers to change it, for saving changes press 'A'.
 Still need to brush program, though. But Segment is working.
